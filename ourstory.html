        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          We are a Danish innovative company, founded by the international
          friends Natalia,Claire,Alexandra,Lilla and Jevgenia. All of us are
          interested in protecting and saving the environment. There are so much
          issues about that theme. We decided to make people think about their
          own health and also to be apart of saving the planet when they buy one
          of our special bamboo bottle. With so much love,patience and time we
          established “Wooter” in early 2019 to fulfill people own needs for a
          sustainable, unique and reusable drinking bottle.After the success of
          ‘Wooter’ and the growing interest in bamboo products, our products
          were launched;

        <h3>What do we do!</h3>
        <p>
          >We believe sustainable handmade designs can change consumer
          behaviour. Our innovative bottle 'Wooter' was created and developed by
          us, and is the world's first handcrafted one-piece bamboo bottle with
          a re-usable silicone inlay and lid. Each individual bottle is hand
          drilled in local Indian homes, using skills passed down through
          families. Why we do it? Our personal interests and values in
          eco-sustainability also on how a product can be responsibly produced,
          using natural materials, limiting waste throughout the production
          process, and supporting communities in rural areas. Our mission is to
          provide access to safe filtered drinking water in 1st, 2nd and 3rd
          world countries.
